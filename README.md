# Rust PoC

Welcome to the rust-poc-lab repository! This project is a collection of Proof of Concepts (PoCs) exploring various aspects of the Rust programming language. The repository is designed to be a learning resource as well as a sandbox for experimenting with Rust’s unique features, libraries, and tools.

## About

The rust-poc-lab is a playground for testing out ideas, implementing patterns, and learning the ins and outs of Rust. From simple algorithms to advanced system-level concepts, this repository covers a range of Rust-related topics:

- **Ownership**: Understanding Rust’s ownership model and how it impacts memory management.
- **Borrowing**: Learning how to borrow references and manage lifetimes in Rust.
- **Concurrency**: Exploring Rust’s concurrency model and how it enables safe, parallel programming.
- **Async**: Working with asynchronous programming in Rust using async/await syntax.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing error handling strategies in Rust, including Result and Option types.
- **Functional Programming**: Leveraging Rust’s functional programming features to write expressive, concise code.
- **System level programming**: Writing low-level code in Rust to interact with the operating system and hardware.
- **Testing**: Writing tests in Rust using the built-in testing framework.
- **Rust ecosystem**: Exploring the Rust ecosystem, including popular libraries, tools, and frameworks.
- **Best practices**: Applying best practices and idiomatic patterns to write clean, efficient Rust code.
- **Performance**: Optimizing Rust code for performance and efficiency.

Each PoC is self-contained and focuses on a specific topic or concept. The code is extensively documented, with explanations of the problem being solved, the approach taken, and the expected output. The PoCs are designed to be run independently, making it easy to experiment with different features of Rust.

## Prerequisites

To run the PoCs in this repository, you need to have Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust by following the instructions on the official [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
To check if Rust is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
rustc --version

rustup --version

cargo --version
```

## Getting Started

To get started with the rust-poc-lab repository, clone the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vickouma77/rust-poc-labs.git

cd rust-poc-labs
```
Build and Run: Each PoC exists in its own directory. To run a specific PoC, navigate to the directory and use Cargo:
    
    ```bash
    cd <poc-directory>
    cargo run
    ```

## Project Structure

The rust-poc-lab structure will be as follows:

```bash
rust-poc-labs/
│
├── poc-1/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── main.rs
│   │   └── lib.rs
│   ├── Cargo.toml

├── poc-2/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── main.rs
│   │   └── lib.rs

├── poc-3/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── main.rs

├── poc-4/
│   ├── src/


├── README.md
├── LICENSE
└── .gitignore
```

Each PoC is contained within its own directory, with the code organized into separate modules and files. The `Cargo.toml` file specifies the dependencies and configuration for the PoC, while the `src/` directory contains the Rust source code.

## Features

- **Modular**: Each PoC is self-contained and focuses on a specific topic or concept.
- **Documented**: Extensive documentation explains the problem, approach, and expected output.
- **Tested**: PoCs include unit tests to verify correctness and demonstrate best practices.
- **Interactive**: PoCs are designed to be run independently, making it easy to experiment with Rust features.
- **Educational**: The repository is a learning resource for exploring Rust’s unique features and capabilities.
